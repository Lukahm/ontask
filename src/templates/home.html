        <h2>The importance of personalisation</h2>
        <p>Learners are more likely to have an effective experience
          when their environment is personalised. Resources, comments,
          suggestions and feedback that take into account the reality of each
          learner are much more effective than those addressing an entire
          cohort. But personalisation has traditionally been based on highly
          detailed pre-conceived models of learner behaviour. OnTask offers an
          environment to personalise resources based on data collected from any
          learning environment.

        <h2>The importance of feedback</h2>
        <p>Feedback is more effective when framed as a dialogue. But such
          dialogue will be highly dependent on the personal situation of each
          learner. How can we combine knowledge about the learners with the
          need to have personalised interaction? OnTask will help instructors
          and learners to initiate this dialogue.</p>

        <h2>The importance of data</h2>
        <p>In the era of technology-mediated learning, data is
          ubiquitous. But instead of providing instantaneous benefits,
          this abundance brings a serious challenge to tranform data into
        actionable knowledge. It is not enough to have data, it is essential
          to use data to support a clearly identified objective in the
          learning environment. How can this support be articulated?
          How can it be used in multiple environments? OnTask
        establishes this connection between data and its use to provide a
          scalable solution to learning personalisation.</p>
