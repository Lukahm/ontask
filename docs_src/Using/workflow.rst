The Workflow
============

    "But anyone who has experienced flow knows that the deep enjoyment it
    provides requires an equal degree of disciplined concentration."
    -â€• Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi

The workflow in OnTask is simply a container that brings together the table,
the operations to upload the data, and the actions to create the
personalized content. The initial screen in OnTask shows the available
workflows as shown in the following figure.

Clicking in the home icon in the upper left corner brings you back to the
list of workflows from any page in the application. Clicking in the icon in
the upper right corner opens the documentation page.

The screen includes the following operations:

   Remember that clicking in the home icon in the upper left corner *closes* the
   workflow and you see the list of available workflows again.

1. Create a new workflow: Clicking in the *New Workflow* button will ask you
   for the name and description of the element.

.. _workflow_import:

2. Importing a file containing a previously exported workflow. Clicking in the
   *Import* button will ask you for the new for the new workflow, the file and
   will let you choose to import only the data, or the data and the actions as
   shown in the following figure

3. Open a workflow to work on it. This is perhaps the most common initial step.
   Once you open or *enter* a workflow, all the operations are applied to that
   context. The platform will remind you in which workflow you are working by
   inserting its name right under the top navigation bar as shown in the
   following figure.

Once you open a workflow, it is locked and no other user can manipulate it (see
:ref:`sharing a workflow <details_sharing>`). If access a workflow and another
user is currently working with it, the platform will not allow you to see the
data and will instead tell you who is holding the lock.

The operations to manage a workflow all become visible once you select it by
clicking on its name.
