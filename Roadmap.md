# Roadmap

0) Full blown implementation of plugins (partially done...)

1) Diferentiate roles within the application:

   - Learner
   
   - Instructor 
  
   - Educational Designer
  
   - Super User
  
2) Prepopulate workflows, actions, matrices, conditions, etc.

3) Implement massive tracking of all the events related to the platform (and 
outside)
  - Student reads email
  
4) Implement scheduling. Two possible approaches
   
   a. Script with manage.py runscript + Cron (or AT in windows)

   b. Celery (well integrated with django, way too complex for OnTask)
